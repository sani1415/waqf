## 📂 Source of truth & public folder

**Edit only in the root.** The app has a single source of truth:

- **Where you edit:** `css/`, `js/`, `pages/`, `index.html`, `404.html` (root folder)
- **Do not edit:** The `public/` folder is **generated** by `npm run copy-public` for Firebase Hosting

**Workflow:**

1. **Development** – Change files only in the root (`css/`, `js/`, `pages/`, etc.). Never edit files inside `public/` manually.
2. **Before deploy** – Run `npm run copy-public` to refresh `public/` from the root. (Or run `firebase deploy`; it runs this step automatically via `predeploy`.)
3. **Local testing** – Prefer serving from the root (e.g. `npm run serve`). If you serve from `public/`, run `npm run copy-public` after changes so you don’t test stale files.

The `public/` folder is in `.gitignore`, so only the root is committed. Everyone works from the same source; `public/` is always recreated by the copy script.

## 💾 Data Storage

The application uses browser **localStorage** to store all data:
- Student information
- Task assignments
- Completion status

**Important Notes:**
- Data persists between sessions
- Clearing browser data will reset the application
- Each browser/device has separate data storage
- Perfect for demonstration and local use
- For production use, you would need a backend server

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

This prototype is ready for the following improvements:
- User authentication system
- Backend server integration
- Database storage
- Email notifications
- File attachments for tasks
- Comments and feedback system
- Due date reminders
- Export progress reports
- Multi-language support

## 🛠️ Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `css/common.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-soft: #7B9EBD;        /* Soft blue */
    --primary-light: #A8C5E3;       /* Light blue */
    --secondary-soft: #B8A5D6;      /* Soft purple */
    --success-soft: #88B68D;        /* Soft green */
    /* ... more colors ... */
}
```

### Modifying Sample Data
Edit the `addSampleData()` method in `js/data-manager.js` to customize initial students and tasks.
